            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a highly efficient and responsible individual who excels both in independent work and team environments. Before my education, I was drawn to the creative aspect of crafting user experiences, but after two years of studying Frontend development, I realized that I also have a strong problem-solving ability, making this profession perfect for me. That’s why I chose to build on my knowledge and learn .NET and C#. Once I complete my education, I want to be able to transform complex problems into elegant solutions.</p>
            <p>Even though my CV might seem a bit dark, I’m actually a lighthearted and open person. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and love to discover new places while learning about different cultures. I believe that experiencing diverse perspectives enriches both my personal and professional life.</p>
